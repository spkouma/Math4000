abstract = {In this paper we present a comprehensive lattice Monte Carlo study of long chain conformations at solid-polymer melt interfaces. Segmental scale interfacial features, like the bond orientational distribution were found to be independent of surface-segment energetics, and statistically identical with Helfand's predictions for the full-occupancy, infinite chain length limit. Conformational statistics of chains longer than 5-6 statistical segments followed the predictions of the Scheutjens-Fleer theory and the same power laws as a single ideal chain at the critical value of the surface-segment adsorption free-energy. Our simulations tested the predictions of random walk next to a "reflective" surface statistics for the spatial variations of chain dimensions and chain center of mass density. It was found that these statistics furnish the correct long chain limit, independently of surface-segment energetics. The random walk next to a "reflective" boundary predictions for the "adsorbed" amount and the distributions of tail, loop, and train number, as well as tail and loop size were in quantitative agreement with the simulation data. The correspondence between random walks and real (or simulated) chains required the knowledge of a single, microscopic parameter, the number of chemical segments per statistical segment, a ∞. This quantity was very close to the average length of adsorbed sequences (trains), in the long chain limit. Our simulations tested thoroughly and established firmly the validity of "reflective" boundary statistics in the melt. The inevitability of these statistics has broad implications on "desorption" kinetics, chain mobility, and chain relaxation, which are currently under study. {\textcopyright} 1993 American Institute of Physics.},

@article{Scheutjens1980,
abstract = {On the basis of an improved matrix model for polymer adsorption, in which the volume of the segments and the segment-solvent interaction is taken into account, the conformation of adsorbed chains is calculated. Results are obtained for the distribution of individual chain segments, the concentration profile due to loops and tails, the root-mean-square layer thickness, the numbers and average length of trains, loops, and tails, and the train, loop, and tail size distribution. The distribution of end segments is quite different from that of middle segments. Ignoring this difference, which is done in older theories, is equivalent to the assumption that end effects are negligible, and is mostly incorrect. The concentration profile due to loop segments decays exponentially with increasing distance from the surface, in agreement with previous theories. However, except for the layers close to the surface, the contribution of tails is dominant over that of the loops. Also in the root-mean-square layer thickness the main contribution is due to tail segments; the layer thickness in all cases is proportional to the square root of the chain length. At reasonable adsorption energies, the conformation of isolated chains is very flat, with most segments in trains, a small fraction in loops, and a negligible fraction in tails. In even very dilute solutions the length of tails becomes significant, while that of loops increases and that of trains decreases. At semidilute concentrations, more than 20{\%} of the segments may be in tails, with an average tail size of about 15{\%} of the chain length. In bulk polymer, a chain in contact with the surface consists, on the average, of two tails of roughly 1/3 chain length each, while in the middle section short trains and longer loops alternate. As far as possible, our results will be compared with other theoretical predictions and with experiment. One result is that the spread of the train size around its average value is identical with the train size distribution as derived by Hoeve et al. {\textcopyright} 1980 American Chemical Society.},

Experiments: Ionization and complexation of weak polyelectrolytes on spherical macroions with monovalent and divalent countrions has been studied with constant–pH Monte Carlo titrations and primitive electrolyte models for linear and star–like polymers capable, also, of forming charged hydrogen bonds. Nanoparticles surface charge has been represented either as a single colloid–centered total charge (CCTC) or as surface–tethered mobile monovalent spherical charges (SMMSC). Findings: Differences in the average number of adsorbed polyelectrolyte arms and their average charge, and in the relative amount of macroion counterions (m–CI's) released upon polymer adsorption are found between CCTC and SMMSC nanoparticles. The amount of the counterions released also depends on the polymer structure. As CCTC adsorbs a lower number of star–like species arms, the degree of condensation of polymer counterions (p–CI's) onto the polyelectrolyte is also substantially higher for the CCTC colloid, with a concurrent decrease of the osmotic coefficient values.},

abstract = {Complex formation between a weak flexible polyelectrolyte chain and one positively charged nanoparticle in presence of explicit counterions and salt particles is investigated using Monte Carlo simulations. The influence of parameters such as the nanoparticle surface charge density, salt valency, and solution property such as the pH on the chain protonation/deprotonation process and monomer adsorption at the nanoparticle surface are systematically investigated. It is shown that the nanoparticle presence significantly modifies chain acid/base and polyelectrolyte conformational properties. The importance of the attractive electrostatic interactions between the chain and the nanoparticle clearly promotes the chain deprotonation leading, at high pH and nanoparticle charge density, to fully wrapped polyelectrolyte at the nanoparticle surface. When the nanoparticle bare charge is overcompensated by the polyelectrolyte charges, counterions and salt particles condense at the surface of the polyelectrolyte-nanoparticle complex to compensate for the excess of charges providing from the adsorbed polyelectrolyte chain. It is also shown that the complex formation is significantly affected by the salt valency. Indeed, with the presence of trivalent salt cations, competition is observed between the nanoparticle and the trivalent cations. As a result, the amount of adsorbed monomers is less important than in the monovalent and divalent case and chain conformations are different due to the collapse of polyelectrolyte segments around trivalent cations out of the nanoparticle adsorption layer. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Chemical Society.},

The central theme is discriminating between the roles of electrostatic and non-electrostatic interactions. In order to emphasize this feature we refrain from discussing practical problems sometimes incurred in polyelectrolyte adsorption like freezing-in of non-equilibrium situations, patchwise attachment, unclear chemistry and only consider solid substrates. Although it is in principle ambiguous to discriminate between coulombic and non-coulombic or "chemical" interactions, it will be shown that, as a rule, non-coulombic contributions to the interactions cannot be neglected. They are responsible for the familiar overcharging. For obtaining more insight, it is recommended to consider electrometric techniques such as electrokinetics, conductometry and potentiometry, in combination with other analytical techniques applied to well-defined systems, for which various parameters can be modulated in a systematic way. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Blanco2019,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}This work addresses the role of charge regulation (CR) and the associated fluctuations in the conformational and mechanical properties of weak polyelectrolytes. Due to CR, changes in the pH-value modifies the average macromolecular charge and conformational equilibria. A second effect is that, for a given average charge per site, fluctuations can alter the intensity of the interactions by means of correlation between binding sites. We investigate both effects by means of Monte Carlo simulations at constant pH-value, so that the charge is a fluctuating quantity. Once the average charge per site is available, we turn off the fluctuations by assigning the same average charge to every site. A constant charge MC simulation is then performed. We make use of a model which accounts for the main fundamental aspects of a linear flexible polyelectrolyte that is, proton binding, angle internal rotation, bond stretching and bending. Steric excluded volume and differentiated treatment for short-range and long-range interactions are also included. This model can be regarded as a kind of “minimal” in the sense that it contains a minimum number of parameters but still preserving the atomistic detail. It is shown that, if fluctuations are activated, gauche state bond probabilities increase and the persistence length decreases, so that the polymer becomes more folded. Macromolecular stretching is also analyzed in presence of CR (the charge depends on the applied force) and without CR (the charge is fixed to the value at zero force). The analysis of the low force scaling behavior concludes that Pincus exponent becomes pH-dependent. Both, with and without CR, a transition from 1/2 at high pH-values (phantom chain) to 3/5 at low pH-values (Pincus regime) is observed. Finally, the intermediate force stretching regime is investigated. It is found that CR induces a moderate influence in the force-extension curves and persistence length (which in this force regime becomes force-dependent). It is thus concluded that the effect of CR on the stretching curves is mainly due to the changes in the average charge at zero force. It is also found that, for the cases studied, the effect of steric excluded volume is almost irrelevant compared to electrostatic interactions.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Absorption of weak polyelectrolytes impacts on properties such as ionization, conformations, and counterion (CI) condensation that are important in several areas of applied and fundamental science. We used a weak polyelectrolyte model and Monte Carlo simulations to investigate how the mentioned properties depend on pH or the size of a spherical cavity (SC) permeable to CIs but not to polyelectrolytes; the latter have either linear or starlike topologies and may be allowed to form charged hydrogen bonds (cH-bonds) between ionized and neutral monomers. Average ionization decreases upon increasing the number of arms at a constant number of monomers; it instead increases with the arm length in large SC due to CI screening. The way SC size, cH-bonds, and pH values interrelate to define ionization is instead more complicate due to arm pairing or clustering when cH-bonds are possible. These induce oscillations in the arm local ionization and impact on both monomer and CI distributions in the complete simulation cell in a way that also depends on polymer topology. The impact of ionization on the confinement free energy is also estimated; this highlighted that cH-bonding may enhance absorption compared with neutral chains. {\textcopyright} 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {The present work aims at studying the outcome and kinetics of competitive adsorption between low and high molar mass chains of neutral polyacrylamide (PAM) or partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) in aqueous solution at the surface of siliceous material. Monodisperse neutral and charged polymers, PAM and HPAM, were synthesized by RAFT/MADIX polymerization and their adsorption, alone or in competitive process, was studied. The analysis of adsorption measurements were carried out quantitatively by size exclusion chromatography which allows for distinguishing the relative adsorption of the chains depending on their molar masses. The effect of the average molar mass, dispersity as well as the kinetics of the displacement of pre-adsorbed polymer chains onto the surface by longer chains was investigated. We evidenced that both PAM and HPAM exhibit the same trend. Close to surface saturation, the high molar mass chains desorb polymer chains of lower molar mass. Moreover, by mixing different monodisperse polymers we were able to model the behavior of the polydisperse systems usually encountered in practical applications. By following adsorption over time, our results show that while low molar mass polymers diffuse rapidly and adsorb first, they are displaced by high molar mass ones once they reach the surface. This result remains unchanged even if the low molar mass chains are added several hours before the higher ones, showing that there is no kinetic limitation to the displacement of low molar mass PAM and HPAM by higher molar mass ones. The understanding and prediction of this complex competitive adsorption behavior over time is of utter importance for the control of the mechanism of action of these polymers notably in industrial processes.},

In this paper, we have employed a molecular theory to study the pH response of strong polyelectrolyte brushes (SPBs), by considering both strong polyelectrolyte-OH− (P–O) hydrogen bonds and polyelectrolyte-counterions (P–C) bonds and their explicit coupling to the SPB conformation. It is found that, when at lower salt concentrations, the combination of P–O hydrogen bonds and P–C bonds results in the pH-responsive properties of a SPB, which are governed by the formation of interchain hydrogen bonds, while at higher salt concentrations, the pH response of the SPB is suppressed by the effect of salt ions. This finding agrees well with the experimental observation. We also investigate the OH−-mediated bridging effect on the structure of a SPB. Based on this theoretical perspective, we predict that the pH response of a SPB will depend on the identity of salt, and the OH−-mediated bridging interactions can induce a vertically phase segregation in a SPB.},

For larger mixing ratios and longer chain lengths, the titration curves start to exhibit complex shapes with multiple inflection points. We also find that in some cases it is possible to differentiate between free and adsorbed chains, based on the charge probability distribution and the probability distribution of the gyration radius. Furthermore, the adsorption of weak polyacids has been compared with that of strong polyacids, and the fraction of adsorbed monomers is found to be slightly larger for the strong polyacids. In addition, the fraction of adsorbed chains can be much lower for the weak polyacids due to their ability to concentrate charge in few chains.},

The slowdown of diffusion of the sticky nanoparticles is predicted to occur at polymer concentrations many orders of magnitude below the overlap concentration, in contrast with the case of non-sticky nanoparticles.

Moreover, charge inversion of proteins through charge regulation, is one explanation for protein adsorption to similarly charged surfaces. While overcharging and charge inversion have been long studied, the explanations for these phenomena are often still debated. Broadly these explanations can be categorized as “chemical” where specific attractive interactions are seen as the cause of charge inversion, and “physical” where purely electrostatic interactions and constraints of geometry are used as explanation. In this review, charge inversion is discussed from a very broad viewpoint, where we draw connections between the various explanations proposed for very different systems. Especially, we highlight the work of Johannes Lyklema, who always carefully balanced between the competing chemical and physical explanations, and demonstrated that only few experimental systems allow just a single explanation.},

Adsorption of polymer coatings, often polyelectrolytes, is typically used to alter hydroxyapatite biointerfaces and alter their bioactivity, for example to promote cell adhesion or prevent biofilm formation. The morphology of the resulting coatings is typically expected to play an important role in determining its bioactivity, yet a full picture of such structures at the surface of hydroxyapatite remains incomplete. In this study, a combination of three model substrates was characterized via in situ ellipsometry, in combination with X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), to study the in situ conformation of hyaluronic acid films adsorbed at the surface of hydroxyapatite. The modes of adsorption of such polyelectrolytes are found to strongly depend on the ability of the bioceramic to readily undergo ion exchange, resulting in the remodeling and partial dissolution of the mineral phase, prior to complexation and re-precipitation at the surface, therefore forming a relatively compact, poorly solvated coating. This is in contrast to the very open and swollen polymer film that is formed on more chemically stable interfaces. Finally, the chemical structure of polyelectrolytes, their molecular weight and crosslinking are observed to impact the morphology of the films generated.},

abstract = {A theoretical model for the adsorption of weak polyelectrolytes from aqueous solution is developed by extending recent theories for uncharged polymers at interfaces with electrostatic contributions. The segment concentration profile is found from the optimal compromise of several factors, such as the conformational entropy of the chains, the configurational entropy of the solvent, the adsorption energy, the solvent quality, the electrostatic repulsion between the segments, and electrostatic interactions due to the surface charge. The degree of dissociation of the polyelectrolyte charges and the dielectric permittivity are allowed to vary with the distance from the surface. Some typical results are presented for the adsorption as a function of polyelectrolyte concentration, solvent quality, pH, and surface charge. A simple equation is derived that relates the critical value of the surface charge $\sigma$ cr0 above (or below) which no adsorption takes place, to the nonelectrostatic adsorption energy $\chi$ s . As far as comparison with experimental data is possible, the predictions of the model are at least semiquantitatively in agreement with experiment. {\textcopyright} 1986.},

abstract = {The review discusses recent results on the adsorption of amyloid fibrils and protein microgels at liquid/fluid interfaces. The application of the shear and dilational surface rheology, atomic force microscopy and passive particle probe tracking allowed for elucidating characteristic features of the protein aggregate adsorption while some proposed hypothesis still must be examined by special methods for structural characterization. Although the distinctions of the shear surface properties of dispersions of protein aggregates from the properties of native protein solutions are higher than the corresponding distinctions of the dilational surface properties, the latter ones give a possibility to obtain new information on the formation of fibril aggregates at the water/air interface. Only the adsorption of BLG microgels and fibrils was studied in some details. The kinetic dependencies of the dynamic surface tension and dilational surface elasticity for aqueous dispersions of protein globules, protein microgels and purified fibrils are similar if the system does not contain flexible macromolecules or flexible protein fragments. In the opposite case the kinetic dependencies of the dynamic surface elasticity can be non-monotonic. The solution pH influences strongly the dynamic surface properties of the dispersions of protein aggregates indicating that the adsorption kinetics is controlled by an electrostatic adsorption barrier if the pH deviates from the isoelectric point. A special section of the review considers the possibility to apply kinetic models of nanoparticle adsorption to the adsorption of protein aggregates.},

abstract = {A critical discussion is presented on the properties and prerequisites of adsorbed polyelectrolytes that have to function as substrates for further layer-by-layer deposition. The central theme is discriminating between the roles of electrostatic and non-electrostatic interactions. In order to emphasize this feature we refrain from discussing practical problems sometimes incurred in polyelectrolyte adsorption like freezing-in of non-equilibrium situations, patchwise attachment, unclear chemistry and only consider solid substrates. Although it is in principle ambiguous to discriminate between coulombic and non-coulombic or "chemical" interactions, it will be shown that, as a rule, non-coulombic contributions to the interactions cannot be neglected. They are responsible for the familiar overcharging. For obtaining more insight, it is recommended to consider electrometric techniques such as electrokinetics, conductometry and potentiometry, in combination with other analytical techniques applied to well-defined systems, for which various parameters can be modulated in a systematic way. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In the melt polymer conformations are nearly ideal according to Flory's ideality hypothesis. Silberberg generalized this statement for chains in the interfacial region. We check the Silberberg argument by analyzing the conformations of a probe chain end-grafted at a solid surface in a sea of floating free chains of concentration $\phi$ by the self-consistent field (SCF) method. Apart from the grafting, probe chain and floating chains are identical. Most of the results were obtained for a standard SCF model with freely jointed chains on a six-choice lattice, where immediate step reversals are allowed. A few data were generated for a five-choice lattice, where such step reversals are forbidden. These coarse-grained models describe the equilibrium properties of flexible atactic polymer chains at the scale of the segment length. The concentration was varied over the whole range from $\phi$ = 0 (single grafted chain) to $\phi$ = 1 (probe chain in the melt). The number of contacts with the surface, average height of the free end and its dispersion, average loop and train length, tail size distribution, end-point and overall segment distributions were calculated for a grafted probe chain as a function of $\phi$, for several chain lengths and substrate/polymer interactions, which were varied from strong repulsion to strong adsorption. The computations show that the conformations of the probe chain in the melt do not depend on substrate/polymer interactions and are very similar to the conformations of a single end-grafted chain under critical conditions, and can thus be described analytically. When the substrate/polymer interaction is fixed at the value corresponding to critical conditions, all equilibrium properties of a probe chain are independent of $\phi$, over the whole range from a dilute solution to the melt. We believe that the conformations of all flexible chains in the surface region of the melt are close to those of an appropriate single chain in critical conditions, provided that one end of the single chain is fixed at the same point as a chain in the melt. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

abstract = {It is well known that lattice and continuum descriptions for polymers at interfaces are, in principle, equivalent. In order to compare the two models quantitatively, one needs a relation between the inverse extrapolation length c as used in continuum theories and the lattice adsorption parameter $\Delta$$\chi$ s (defined with respect to the critical point). So far, this has been done only for ideal chains with zero segment volume in extremely dilute solutions. The relation $\Delta$$\chi$ ss(c) is obtained by matching the boundary conditions in the two models. For depletion (positive c and $\Delta$$\chi$ ss) the result is very simple: $\Delta$$\chi$ ss = ln(1 + c/5). For adsorption (negative c and $\Delta$$\chi$ ss) the ideal-chain treatment leads to an unrealistic divergence for strong adsorption: c decreases without bounds and the train volume fraction exceeds unity. This due to the fact that for ideal chains the volume filling cannot be accounted for. We extend the treatment to real chains with finite segment volume at finite concentrations, for both good and theta solvents. For depletion the volume filling is not important and the ideal-chain result $\Delta$$\chi$ ss = ln(1 + c/5) is generally valid also for non-ideal chains, at any concentration, chain length, or solvency. Depletion profiles can be accurately described in terms of two length scales: $\Delta$$\chi$ s = tanh2[(z + p)/$\delta$], where the depletion thickness (distal length) $\delta$ is a known function of chain length and polymer concentration, and the proximal length p is a known function of c (or $\Delta$$\chi$ ss) and $\delta$. For strong repulsion p = 1/c (then the proximal length equals the extrapolation length), for weaker repulsion p depends also on chain length and polymer concentration (then p is smaller than 1/c). In very dilute solutions we find quantitative agreement with previous analytical results for ideal chains, for any chain length, down to oligomers. In more concentrated solutions there is excellent agreement with numerical self-consistent depletion profiles, for both weak and strong repulsion, for any chain length, and for any solvency. For adsorption the volume filling dominates. As a result c now reaches a lower limit c ≈ -0.5 (depending slightly on solvency). This limit follows immediately from the condition of a fully occupied train layer. Comparison with numerical SCF calculations corroborates that our analytical result is a good approximation.We suggest some simple methods to determine the interaction parameter (either c or $\Delta$$\chi$ s) from experiments. The relation $\Delta$$\chi$ s(c) provides a quantitative connection between continuum and lattice theories, and enables the use of analytical continuum results to describe the adsorption (and stretching) of lattice chains of any chain length. For example, a fully analytical treatment of mechanical desorption of a polymer chain (including the temperature dependence and the phase transitions) is now feasible. {\textcopyright} 2012 American Institute of Physics.},

We have determined several overall layer properties including the monomer volume fraction profiles, the layer thickness, adsorbances related to loops and to tails, as well as the variation of the crossover distance between loops and tails for different particle radii and fixed polymer length. When the radius of the sphere is small enough to affect the loop layer, one enters a single-adsorbed-chain regime, characterized by a critical sphere radius. In this regime, structural changes in the adsorbed layer arise. For such small sphere, the loop layer is confined to a region whose thickness is of the order of the radius of the adsorbing sphere, and two long tails dominate the outer layer and the adsorbance due to tails dominates that due to loops. An analysis of the structure of the outer tail layer for this small sphere case is also presented. {\textcopyright} EDP Sciences, Societ{\`{a}} Italiana di Fisica and Springer-Verlag 2007.},

abstract = {Homopolymer adsorption from a dilute solution on an interacting (attractive) surface under static equilibrium conditions is studied in the framework of a Hamiltonian model. The model makes use of the density of chain ends n1,e and utilizes the concept of the propagator G describing conformational probabilities to locally define the polymer segment density or volume fraction $\phi$; both n1,e and $\phi$ enter into the expression for the system free energy. The propagator G obeys the Edwards diffusion equation for walks in a self-consistent potential field. The equilibrium distribution of chain ends and, consequently, of chain conformational probabilities is found by minimizing the system free energy. This results in a set of model equations that constitute the exact continuum-space analog of the Scheutjens-Fleer (SF) lattice statistical theory for the adsorption of interacting chains. Since for distances too close to the surface the continuum formulation breaks down, the continuum model is here employed to describe the probability of chain configurations only for distances z greater than 2l, where l denotes the segment length, from the surface; instead, for distances z≤2l, the SF lattice model is utilized. Through this novel formulation, the lattice solution at z=2l provides the boundary condition for the continuum model. The resulting hybrid (lattice for distances z≤2l, continuum for distances z{\textgreater}2l) model is solved numerically through an efficient implementation of the pseudospectral collocation method. Representative results obtained with the new model and a direct application of the SF lattice model are extensively compared with each other and, in all cases studied, are found to be practically identical. {\textcopyright} 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

Electroosmotic flow (EOF) velocity is measured by using the current-slope method in the modified nanochannel with various numbers of the deposition layers. The results reveal that the growth of polyelectrolyte layer in nanochannels is quite different from that on flat substrates. In small nanochannels, the increment of the multilayer thickness will be limited unlike that on flat surfaces. As the number of the deposition layers increases, the nanochannel size will decrease initially and reach a saturation value finally where the nanochannel cannot be filled with the polyelectrolytes. It is observed that both the decrement and the saturation value of the nanochannel size strongly depend on the concentration of the salt addition in polyelectrolyte solutions. At low ionic concentration, increasing the salt addition increases the average layer thickness within the nanochannels and decreases the saturation value of nanochannel size. However, the effects of salt addition can demonstrate opposite behaviors at high ionic concentration. The EOF can be alternatively reversed in the modified nanochannels by repeatedly coating oppositely charged polyelectrolytes, and the EOF velocity will gradually decrease with the increasing deposition cycles.},

As in simple electrolyte solutions [Z.-G. Wang,Phys. Rev. E 81, 021501 (2010)], the RGF provides a unified theory forelectrostatic fluctuations, accounting for both dielectric and charge correlationeffects in terms of the self-energy. Unlike simple ions, the polyelectrolyte self energydepends intimately on the chain conformation, and our theory naturally provides aself-consistent determination of the response of intramolecular chain structure topolyelectrolyte and salt concentrations. The effects of the chain-conformation on theself-energy and thermodynamics are especially pronounced for flexiblepolyelectrolytes at low polymer and salt concentrations, where application of thewrong chain structure can lead to a drastic misestimation of the electrostaticcorrelations. By capturing the expected scaling behavior of chain size from dilute tosemi-dilute regimes, our theory provides improved estimates of the self energy at lowpolymer concentrations and correctly predicts the eventual N-independenceof the critical temperature and concentration of salt-free solutions of flexiblepolyelectrolytes. We show that the self energy can be interpreted in terms of aninfinite-dilution energy $\mu$m,0el and a finite concentrationcorrelation correction $\mu$corr which tends to cancel out the formerwith increasing concentration.},

We examine how the structural correlations between ionic groups on polyelectrolytes impact the counterion binding. Treating the electrostatic correlation free energy using the classical Debye-H{\"{u}}ckel expression leads to complete counterion dissociation in the concentrated regime. This unphysical behavior is shown to stem from improper regularization of the self-energy of dissociated ions and polyions and is mitigated by smearing point-like charges across a finite width. The influence of the self-energy on counterion binding is elaborated on by generalizing the Debye-H{\"{u}}ckel free energy to polyelectrolytes with variable fractal dimension and stiffness. In the dilute regime, a greater propensity for binding is found for chains with more compact architectures, which in turn reduces the harsh self-repulsions of tightly packed arrangements of charge. In the concentrated regime, the effects of electrostatic correlations weaken due to screening and the extent of binding is governed by a balance of short-ranged interactions and the translational entropy of ions.},

abstract = {Based on extensive Monte Carlo simulations and analytical considerations we study the electrostatically driven adsorption of flexible polyelectrolyte chains onto charged Janus nanospheres. These net-neutral colloids are composed of two equally but oppositely charged hemispheres. The critical binding conditions for polyelectrolyte chains are analysed as function of the radius of the Janus particle and its surface charge density, as well as the salt concentration in the ambient solution. Specifically for the adsorption of finite-length polyelectrolyte chains onto Janus nanoparticles, we demonstrate that the critical adsorption conditions drastically differ when the size of the Janus particle or the screening length of the electrolyte are varied. We compare the scaling laws obtained for the adsorption-desorption threshold to the known results for uniformly charged spherical particles, observing significant disparities. We also contrast the changes to the polyelectrolyte chain conformations close to the surface of the Janus nanoparticles as compared to those for simple spherical particles. Finally, we discuss experimentally relevant physico-chemical systems for which our simulations results may become important. In particular, we observe similar trends with polyelectrolyte complexation with oppositely but heterogeneously charged proteins. This journal is {\textcopyright} the Partner Organisations 2014.},

abstract = {When a solution of polyanionic chains is placed in contact with a polycationic brush, the polyanions adsorb into the brush. We investigate the influence of the charge sequences of the free and bound species on the thermodynamics of polyelectrolyte adsorption. As model systems, we consider free and brush polyelectrolytes with either block or alternating charge sequences, and study the adsorption process using coarse-grained Langevin dynamics with implicit solvent, explicit counterions, and excess salt. Free energy, internal energy, and entropy of adsorption are computed using umbrella sampling methods. When the number of polyanions exceed the number of polycations, the brush becomes overcharged. Free chains adsorb most strongly when both free and tethered chains have a block charge sequence, and most weakly when both species have an alternating sequence. Adsorption is stronger when the free polyanion has a block sequence and the tethered polycation is alternating than in the reverse case of an alternating free polymer and a tethered block copolymer. Sequence-dependent effects are shown to be largely energetic, rather than entropic, in origin.},

abstract = {The titration behavior of weak polyelectrolytes is of high importance, due to their uses in new technologies including nanofiltration and drug delivery applications. A comprehensive picture of polyelectrolyte titration under relevant conditions is currently lacking, due to the complexity of systems involved in the process. One must contend with the inherent structural and solvation properties of the polymer, the presence of counterions, and local chemical equilibria enforced by background salt concentration and solution acidity. Moreover, for these cases, the systems of interest have locally high concentrations of monomers, induced by polymer connectivity or confinement, and thus deviate from ideal titration behavior. This work furthers knowledge in this limit utilizing hybrid Monte Carlo-Molecular Dynamics simulations to investigate the influence of salt concentration, pKa, pH, and counterion valence in determining the coil-to-globule transition of poorly solvated weak polyelectrolytes. We characterize this transition at a range of experimentally relevant salt concentrations and explicitly examine the role multivalent salts play in determining polyelectrolyte ionization behavior and conformations. These simulations serve as an essential starting point in understanding the complexation between weak polyelectrolytes and ion rejection of self-assembled copolymer membranes.},

abstract = {Adsorption of uncharged homopolymers of various flexibilities in good solvent onto planar surfaces at various polymer-surface interaction strengths have been investigated by employing a coarse-grained bead-spring polymer model using simulation techniques. The polymer flexibility ranged from fully flexible to rod-like polymers, and the adsorption strength varied from weak to strong adsorption. Equilibrium adsorption properties were determined by Monte Carlo simulations, and adsorption processes were investigated by Brownian dynamic simulations. In the latter case, the initial systems were composed of a polymer solution and a surface separated by a slab of polymer-free solution. The equilibrium properties of the interfacial systems have been analyzed by monitoring bead and polymer density profiles, number of adsorbed beads and polymers, the components of the radius of gyration perpendicular and parallel to the surface as well as tail, loop, and train statistics. Flexible polymers adsorbed in two layers, and at an increasing surface attraction the number of adsorbed beads and polymers increased and the adsorbed polymers become flatter, whereas rod-like polymers adsorbed in a single and thin layer with a nematic-like order. At increasing polymer stiffness at fixed surface attraction strength, the number of adsorbed beads increased, whereas the number of adsorbed polymers, the polymer extension perpendicular to the surface, and the fraction of beads in tails all displayed nontrivial maxima at similar persistence length. The dynamic analysis showed that the initial adsorption was diffusion controlled, but soon became governed by the probability of a polymer to be captured by the surface attraction. Flexible polymers became flattened after attaching, but their final relaxation mechanism involved an increased perpendicular extension with fewer adsorbed beads and longer tails driven by the surface pressure originating from the surrounding adsorbed polymers. The stiff polymers displayed a much slower final relaxation to their equilibrium state; this relaxation predominately constituting a packing of the rod-like polymers in a 2-dimensional nematic order. Furthermore, we have defined an integration time denoting the adsorption time for adsorbed polymers to become fully integrated into the adsorbed layer. Integration times and residence times of integrated polymers became longer with increasing polymer stiffness and increasing bead-surface attraction. {\textcopyright} 2010 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Polycation conformation upon adsorption to a negatively charged surface can be modulated by its charge density. At high charge density monomers directly interact with the surface in a ‘trains' conformation and as charge density decreases a high degree of monomers dangle into solution in a ‘loops and tails' conformation. In this study, the conformations of polycations upon adsorption to montmorillonite, as a function of polycation charge (20, 50 and 100{\%} of the monomers, denoted as P-Q20, P-Q50 and P-Q100) were characterized and in accordance with their conformation, the adsorption of non-ionic and anionic molecules by the composite was tested. As expected, the adsorption of the nonionic pharmaceuticals increased to a composite with a ‘loops and tails' conformation, due to both conformation and chemical properties. On the other hand, the anionic molecules, gemfibrozil and diclofenac, preferably adsorbed to composites with higher charge density (Q50 or Q100 composites). However, they showed different tendency toward the composites, i.e. higher adsorption of diclofenac by Q100 composite vs. higher adsorption of gemfibrozil by Q50 composite. To elucidate the differences in adsorption between these two pharmaceuticals, density functional theory calculations were employed. Both gemfibrozil and diclofenac were found to be better stabilized by methyl pyridinium sites (prevail in Q100 composite). The preferable adsorption of gemfibrozil by Q50 composite was explained by the presence of ‘loops and tails' conformation enabling additional adsorption sites and diverse monomer-target molecule orientations.},

With increasing surface coverage, train segments were observed to maintain constant average anisotropy with respect to the solid surface. Free segments were preferentially flattened when the surface coverage was low, but with increasing surface coverage became progressively more random in orientation.

abstract = {The adsorbed amounts and interfacial conformations of a low-molecular-weight oligomer of a weak cationic polyelectrolyte (15-unit chain of dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate, DMAEMA) on colloidal silica were examined, with the ultimate intent of providing perspective on the adsorption of high-molecular-weight weak polyelectrolytes. At all but the lowest ionic strengths or highest pHs, over the full range of adsorbed oligomer amounts on each isotherm, the interfacial conformation was relatively insensitive to coverage with train fractions from 0.8 to 1. This occurs because short oligomeric chains are not capable of forming long loops or tails found in higher-molecular-weight homopolymer layers. Variations in pH altered the backbone and surface charge densities, changing the density of contact points for adsorption. This was apparent in the NMR solvent relaxation behavior, which suggested the tightest binding near pH 6, and a sharp drop in the train fraction at high pH, just as the adsorption began to diminish with reduced backbone protonation. Variations in ionic strength screened repulsions among adsorbed oligomers, an effect most apparent at low ionic strengths. NMR solvent relaxation data provided substantial evidence for differences in the anchoring of DMAEMA oligomer and adsorbed trains of a nonionic homopolymer such as polyethylene oxide (T. Cosgrove, M. A. Cohen Stuart, and G. P. van der Beek, Langmuir 7,327 (1991)). DMAEMA adsorbs at a small number of discrete points on side chains, while with polyethylene oxide the literature suggested every monomer on the main backbone can potentially adhere to the surface, giving a less mobile interface from the perspective of the solvent. {\textcopyright} 2001 Academic Press.},

abstract = {We resolve a thermodynamic inconsistency in previous theoretical descriptions of the free energy of chemisorption (charge regulation) under conditions where nonelectrostatic physisorption is included, as applied to surface forces and particle-particle interactions. We clarify the role of nonelectrostatic ion physisorption energies and show that a term previously thought to represent physisorbed ion concentrations (activities) should instead be interpreted as a "partial ion activity" based solely on the electrostatic physisorption energy and bulk concentration, or alternatively on the nonelectrostatic physisorption energy and surface concentration. Second, the chemisorption energy must be understood as the change in chemical potential after subtracting the electrostatic energy, not subtracting the physisorption energy. Consequently, a previously reported specific ion nonelectrostatic physisorption contribution to the chemisorption free energy is annulled. We also report a correction to the calculation of surface charge. The distinction in "partial ion activity" evaluated from bulk concentration or from surface concentration opens a way to study nonequilibrium forces where chemisorption is in equilibrium with physisorbed ions but not in equilibrium with bulk ions, e.g., by a jump in ion concentrations.},

abstract = {We discuss in a qualitative way the physical background of a recently developed polymer adsorption theory, in which all the possible chain conformations for interacting chain molecules near an adsorbing interface are taken into account. Any conformation is described as a step-weighted random walk in a lattice. Each step is weighted according to a segmental weighting factor that contains the adsorption energy (for segments in contact with the surface), the entropy of mixing, and the attraction or repulsion between segments and solvent molecules. A suitable computing method is used to calculate the contribution of all chain conformations to the concentration profile, to the adsorbed amount, to the fraction of trains, loops and tails, to the layer thickness, etc. The theory is valid for any chain length and any concentration in the solution. Results for various chain lengths are given. Oligomers have a low affinity for the surface, whereas polymer adsorption isotherms are of the well known high affinity type. Three concentration regimes can be distinguished. In (extremely) dilute solutions the molecules on the surface adsorb as isolated chains (the Henry region). {\textcopyright} 1982.},

Films with different conformations were formed by Janus nanoparticles. The effects of charge distributions of Janus nanoparticles and the surface on the film structures and dynamic adsorption behavior were investigated in detail. When the surface is highly charged, Janus nanoparticles tend to form single particles or small clusters. In these cases, the surface charge distribution plays an important role in regulating the process of electrostatic adsorption. When the amount of surface charges is reduced, the effect of charge distribution of Janus nanoparticles becomes significant. The repulsive interactions between Janus nanoparticles determine the aggregation behavior of Janus nanoparticles as well as the shape of adsorption structures, which tends to separate Janus nanoparti-cles and results in a thin adsorption layer and small clusters. When the number of positive charges on the surface of Janus nanoparticle approaches that of negative charges, Janus nanoparticles aggregate into large clusters close to charged surface.

abstract = {We theoretically study dense polymer solutions under open (capillary and slit) and closed (box) confinement. The theory is formulated for grand-canonical polymers and corrections to the self-consistent mean-field results are discussed. In contrast to the mean-field prediction, we found that the partition function of a labeled chain is affected by confinement even under neutral von Neumann boundary conditions and the chain length distribution is biased to short chains. As the container size increases, the contribution of the transverse excited states to the free energy of a labeled chain is found to approach its bulk value nonmonotonically (through an extremum) for the box and the capillary confinement but not for the slit. So does the confinement free energy of a labeled chain. The confinement energy of the solution is well behaved for open confinement but formally diverges for a closed box in the limit that the average chain length goes to infinity. Counted per chain, the confinement energy of the dense solution is qualitatively weaker than for a single ideal chain under similarly strong confinement (by one power in transverse container size). The container boundary contributes a surface tension to the free energy, which makes the effective monomer-wall affinity more repulsive. This correction increases with the average chain length. If present, edge or vertex singularities also contribute to the grand potential of the solution.},

Three dimensional filament configurations of partially adsorbed F-actin polymers are visualized with total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. This information is used to determine the location of the adsorption/desorption transition and extract the statistics of trains, tails and loops of partially adsorbed filament configurations. In contrast to long flexible filaments which primarily desorb by the formation of loops, the desorption of stiff, finite-sized filaments is largely driven by fluctuating filament tails. Simulations quantitatively reproduce our experimental data and allow us to extract universal laws that explain scaling of the adsorption-desorption transition with relevant microscopic parameters. Our results demonstrate how the adhesion strength, filament stiffness, length, as well as the configurational space accessible to the desorbed filament can be used to design the characteristics of filament adsorption and thus engineer properties of composite biopolymeric materials.},

abstract = {The adsorption of weak polybase on oppositely charged planar surfaces has been investigated numerically by using the self-consistent field theory (SCFT). Particular attention was paid to the interplay of monomer-surface electrostatic and non-electrostatic interactions in the adsorption behaviors of weak polybase. In this study, the strength of monomer-surface non-electrostatic interactions was set to be no more than the thermal energy kBT. It was found from the numerical study that in the regime of low surface charge density of the substrate and low pH or high bulk degree of ionization, both the screening-enhanced and screening-reduced salt effects emerge. On the contrary, in the opposite regime, only the screening-reduced salt effect was observed. Moreover, the overall charge neutrality inside the adsorption layer was analyzed. The underlying mechanism governing the adsorption behaviors of weak polybase on oppositely charged surfaces was elucidated.},

(ESA), for the preparation of thin polymer coatings. In comparison to other, more established self-organization techniques, this recent method is distinguished by its simplicity, versatility, and speed. In particular, the tendency for self-healing is unique. Emphasis is given to the role of the molecular structure of the polyelectrolytes, and to the nature of the support. Also, various parameters for the preparation of multilayer films are highlighted, which are very important due to the kinetic control of the build-up process. The structure of the resulting coatings, their quality and stability, chemical reactions in the films, and potential applications are discussed.},

However, both the Langmuir-Blodgett technique and chemisorption from solution can be used only with certain classes of molecules. An alternative approach-fabrication of multilayers by consecutive adsorption of polyanions and polycations-is far more general and has been extended to other materials such as proteins or colloids. Because polymers are typically flexible molecules, the resulting superlattice architectures are somewhat fuzzy structures, but the absence of crystallinity in these films is expected to be beneficial for many potential applications.]},

The central idea is to first synthesize monodisperse polymer gel nanoparticles, then self-assemble them into a 3D network, and eventually covalently bond them. The covalent bonding contributes to the structural stability, while self-assembly provides them with crystal structures that diffract light, resulting in colors. N-isopropylacrylamide (NIPA) gel has been used as a model system for this study.

@article{doi:10.1002/ijch.199600050,
	abstract = {Abstract Various strategies are described for the bio-functionalization of solid substrates by design of interfacial architectures. The first approach is based on the self-assembly process of long-chain thiol molecules from solution to a (noble) metal surface. If some of these building blocks carry a binding site (ligand) for proteins (receptors, antibodies, etc.) the metal surface can be tailored for maximum specific binding while simultaneously minimizing nonspecific adsorption. The second concept is based on polymers that are covalently attached to (oxide) surfaces. The preparation of these (end-) grafted functional polymers involves either the binding of preformed macromolecules to corresponding sites at the surface of the support or the recently introduced “grafting-from” method, by which an initiator molecule is first covalently bound to the surface and then activated — either by heat or light — in the presence of suitable monomer units such that a polymer chain grows from the solid/solution interface. Finally, the functionalization of patterned surfaces by peptide chains that mimic the binding domains of cell adhesion proteins is summarized. It is demonstrated that not only the selective adhesion of neuronal cells can then be controlled, but also their development with the outgrowth of dendrites and axons.},
